                    Hi, I'm an IT student at PLV, currently in my second year, and my
                    journey in technology has been an exciting one so far. I started
                    with little to no programming knowledge, but over time, I’ve
                    explored and learned various technologies that are shaping my
                    skills and future career.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: black; margin: 1.5rem 0">
                    Discovering the World of Programming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My programming journey began with the basics—learning
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
                        target="_blank"
                        >HTML</a
                    >,
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"
                        target="_blank"
                        >CSS</a
                    >, and
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
                        target="_blank"
                        >Javascript</a
                    >. These languages form the foundation of web development, and
                    understanding them was crucial for me. At first, it felt
                    overwhelming, especially trying to grasp how everything connects
                    to create functional web pages. With practice and dedication, I
                    managed to build small projects, such as basic websites and
                    interactive components.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After taking a break from web development, I noticed that some of
                    the concepts felt unfamiliar again. To address this, I started
                    reviewing the fundamentals, focusing on key aspects like
                    responsive design, DOM manipulation, and integrating CSS for
                    user-friendly designs. This review not only refreshed my memory
                    but also gave me more confidence to dive deeper into more complex
                    topics.

                <h2 style="color: black; margin: 1.5rem 0">
                    Diving Into Full-Stack Development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I progressed, I expanded my knowledge by learning the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/"
                        target="_blank"
                        >MERN</a
                    >
                    stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Each technology brought
                    something unique to the table. MongoDB introduced me to databases
                    and how to store and retrieve data efficiently. Express.js taught
                    me the importance of creating server-side logic and handling API
                    requests, which is an essential part of any modern web
                    application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React, on the other hand, completely transformed how I viewed
                    front-end development. Building reusable components and working
                    with state management opened new doors for creating dynamic user
                    interfaces. With Node.js, I understood how JavaScript could be
                    extended to work seamlessly on the server side, making it
                    possible to write full-stack applications using a single
                    programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm focusing on learning authentication techniques in
                    Express.js to create secure and user-friendly applications.
                    Security is a vital part of any software, and I want to ensure
                    that the applications I build are both robust and reliable.

                    Building a Real-World Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant milestones in my journey has been
                    creating an Airport Management System, a desktop application
                    developed using
                    <a
                        href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/"
                        target="_blank"
                        >C#</a
                    >
                    and
                    <a
                        href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/?view=netdesktop-9.0"
                        target="_blank"
                        >WPF</a
                    >. This project was born out of my interest in combining
                    user-friendly interfaces with efficient backend logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing the application taught me how to structure complex
                    software solutions. Using WPF and XAML for the user interface, I
                    learned how to position elements, handle events, and manage
                    resources such as images and fonts. A notable challenge I faced
                    was dealing with PNG images that had transparency issues, where
                    the transparent backgrounds appeared filled. Solving this
                    required exploring image formats and ensuring compatibility with
                    WPF's rendering engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also experimented with global object instances to improve the
                    app’s efficiency. This approach allowed me to reuse objects
                    across different modules without the overhead of creating new
                    instances, ensuring better performance and memory usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another exciting aspect was designing a responsive UI. For
                    example, I worked on ensuring that the border below the dashboard
                    expanded correctly when resizing the window. These small
                    adjustments taught me how important it is to pay attention to the
                    details of user interaction.
                </p>

                    My Goals Moving Forward

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue learning and building on
                    the foundation I’ve established. My goals include:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strengthening my front-end development skills by diving
                        deeper into React and using tools like

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exploring new technologies, frameworks, and tools that can
                        enhance my problem-solving skills and efficiency.

                <p>
                    This journey has been one of growth and discovery, and I’m eager
                    to see how I can continue to evolve as a developer. Every project
                    I take on teaches me something new, and I’m excited for the
                    challenges and opportunities that lie ahead!
